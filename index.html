      <p class="text-muted">A Christian school is a school run on Christian principles or by a Christian organization.
        The nature of Christian schools varies enormously from country to country, according to the religious, educational, and political cultures. In some countries, there is a strict separation of church and state, so all religious schools are private; in others, there is an established church whose teachings form an integral part of the state-operated educational system; in yet others, the state subsidizes religious schools of various denominations.</p>

    <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Every school has a canteen and it makes it easy for students to get food from these canteens.

      On a busy day when mothers donâ€™t get time to pack lunchboxes or snack boxes, these canteens are really handy and a lifesaver.
      
      Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.

      Our canteen provides all kinds of food. You would get the vegetarian food and the non-vegetarian food. You have the rice varieties which may include the normal meals or fried rice and also fast food kind of items which includes sandwiches, rolls, wraps, burgers etc.Even soft drinks and packet juices are provided. You just need to choose which food you would like to have and pay accordingly. The canteen food is very tasty and it is very neat. The food is all sealed and served in packets, so that it makes it easy to carry around and have food. There is a canteen in-charge that takes care of the quality of the food and the neatness of the canteen.

      The cooks of the canteen are very nice and they make sure that we students get the best food. Since the canteen functions very well, most of the students prefer to have food from here and the canteen would be full almost on all working days.
      
      Even on special occasions or get together, the canteen provides food for the students and staff participating in the occasion or get together. It is really great to have a canteen in the premises of the school and to get good and tasty food, when we want.</p>
